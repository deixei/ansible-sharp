# About the Author
  
  My name is Marcio Parente, I was born in Porto, Portugal in 1976, currently living in Zug, 
Switzerland.
  I have gained my knowledgeable as an IT expert over two decades of experience in software 
product delivery, and I have always had a strong interest in developing high-quality software and 
remaining up to date on the latest technological developments. Because of my extensive 
knowledge in serverless cloud architectures as well as continuous delivery pipelines, I am an 
invaluable asset to any team.
  
  But my interests go much beyond what I do for a living. In addition to this, I have the spirit of an 
explorer and the ability to fly at an altitude of 10,000 metres and dive to a depth of 100 metres. 
Even in the frenetic environment of the information technology industry, I can keep a level head 
and keep my attention focused on the work at hand because to the adventurous spirit that I have. 
This has been very beneficial to me in my professional life.
  
  I consider myself to be a natural leader, and as such, I am always seeking for new ways to disrupt 
the status quo and take on additional duties. Because of my strong interpersonal skills and my 
ability to connect effectively with people at all levels, I have been able to achieve a great deal of 
professional success thus far in my career.
  
  I am always motivated by an insatiable thirst for knowledge and the want to better myself, and I 
am always seeking for fresh problems to solve. I am constantly motivated to challenge myself to 
reach new heights and accomplish great things, regardless of whether I am engaged in labouring 
over a difficult software project or venturing into the depths of the ocean.
  
  I have always been lured to the excitement of new experiences. I devoted a great deal of energy 
and enthusiasm to each of my activities, which included rock climbing, photography, travelling, and 
coding.
  
  I made the decision to combine my interests and set off on a journey during which I would 
photograph the splendour of the world via the lens of my camera while simultaneously challenging 
myself to climb to new heights.
  
  I couldn't help but experience a feeling of success and pleasure as I travelled to gorgeous locales 
and ascended tough cliffs throughout my time there. But for me, it was much more than simply the 
physical accomplishment. It was about making a connection with the natural world and capturing 
the beauty of nature in its untouched, unspoiled state via my photography.
  
  When I got back to my house, I put my coding talents to use by coming up with new ideas, 
developing them further, and sharing them with the rest of the world.
  
  But the friendships and connections I made along the road were by far the most rewarding 
aspect of the whole experience. The friends I made while climbing the rock face and while I was 
travelling quickly became like family to me, and the experiences we produced together will be 
ingrained in my mind for the rest of my life.
  
  In the end, it wasn't the interests in and of themselves that were important; rather, it was the 
feelings and relationships that they sparked in me. And I am thankful for each and every one of 
those moments.
