# A DevOps engineer story
  
  Mary was working as the DevOps engineer for a company that was expanding, and she was 
continually having trouble keeping up with the expectations of the company. Because the software 
used by the organisation was constructed using a wide variety of distinct components and 
approaches, it is difficult to maintain and keep up to date. To make matters even more difficult, the 
programme was developed with the intention of functioning across a variety of platforms and 
technologies, which makes it much more challenging to administer.
   
  One day, Mary's employer presented her with a new problem, which was that the company was 
intending to switch from on premises datacentre to one cloud provider, and they wanted her to 
ensure that the transfer happened well. Not only did this include modernising the software so that 
it could operate on the new cloud platform, but it also necessitated transforming the tightly coupe 
service architecture of the organisation into a micro segmented design that was more adaptable.
   
  Mary was aware that in order to do this work, she would need to locate a method that would 
simplify the process of upgrading and maintaining the software. To begin, she put into practise the 
"everything as code" philosophy, which meant that each and every component of the software was 
defined and controlled by means of the code. Because of this, it became much simpler to monitor 
changes and settings, as well as to maintain a record of the application's status at any given point in 
time.
   
  Mary was aware, however, that there is always an element of danger associated with any 
change, and she realised that she needed to exercise caution in order to reduce the negative effects 
on the company. She automated as much of the process as she could by utilising technologies such 
as Ansible and Azure, and she even made use of artificial intelligence to assist her with some of the 
more difficult jobs.
   
  Mary was required to keep in mind the possibility of vendor lock-in while she worked on the 
changeover. She was aware of the fact that selecting the appropriate technology may either 
facilitate or impede the inventive growth of the organisation; hence, she made it a point to have an 
open mind and think about a variety of possibilities. In the end, she decided that the best way to 
construct the new cloud platform for the organisation would be to employ a combination of tools 
such as Python, .NET, and Bicep.
   
  Mary utilised several concepts, such as landing zones and blueprints, to set up the infrastructure 
in order to make the transition as painless as possible. She also used code templates and 
scaffolding to speed up the software development process. She went so far as to leverage 
reference designs and established best practises in order to make sure that the new platform was 
as reliable and scalable as it could be.
   
  The company was able to make a smooth transition to its new cloud platform as a result of 
Mary's hard work and attention to detail, and the software is now simpler to maintain and upgrade 
than it ever was before. Additionally, the company was able to offer new features and upgrades to 
its clients at a rate that was far faster than in the past, which added even more value to the 
company's operations. This was made possible with the assistance of automation and cloud 
computing.
   
  The difficult task of moving the company's software to a new cloud provider was given to Mary, 
and she was entrusted with making the switch. She was aware that this would not be an easy 
accomplishment. In any case, I think you'll be able to connect to this because we've all been in 
similar circumstances at one point or another. For example, we have seen the transition from on-
premises data centres to the cloud, mainframes to the cloud, and some of us have even moved 
from one cloud to another. Others will recall the transition from Oracle to SQL or from Oracle to 
Postgres, not to mention the move from Java to .NET.
  We have experienced a theme of transformation similar to Mary's throughout the course of our 
careers.
  
  Change is inevitable, the hardship of it depends on how well we can flex our setups.
  
  The saying "change is inevitable" means that change is a natural part of life, and it is something 
that is bound to happen. We cannot avoid change, no matter how hard we try. It is something that 
is constantly happening around us and within us.
  
  However, the difficulty of change and the hardships that come with it can vary depending on 
how well we are able to adapt and flex our setups. In other words, our ability to adjust to change 
and be flexible can determine how challenging the experience of change will be for us.
  
  When we are able to be flexible and adapt to change, we can make the transition smoother and 
less stressful. It allows us to approach change with a positive attitude and find new opportunities 
and ways to grow. On the other hand, when we resist change and refuse to adapt, we can find 
ourselves feeling overwhelmed, anxious, and stuck.
  
  Therefore, it is important to recognize that change is inevitable and to develop our flexibility and 
adaptability skills so that we can navigate the challenges that come with it. By doing so, we can turn 
the hardships of change into opportunities for growth and development.
