## DORA Metrics

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) is a platform that provides resources and tools for 
assessing and improving DevOps practices. The platform offers a range of services, including 
benchmarking assessments, coaching and training, and research on DevOps practices and their 
impact on organizational performance. The platform is based on the work of a team of researchers 
who have conducted extensive research on DevOps practices and their impact on software 
development outcomes. Overall, the DORA platform is a valuable resource for organizations looking 
to improve their DevOps practices and achieve better outcomes in software development.
  
  Metrics are quantitative measures used to assess various aspects of DevOps practices and 
software development. Here are some commonly used DevOps metrics:
  
  Deployment frequency: The frequency at which code changes are deployed to production.
  Lead time: The time it takes from committing a change to the code to deploying it to production.
  Mean time to recover (MTTR): The average time it takes to recover from a production incident 
or outage.
  Change failure rate: The percentage of changes that result in degraded service or service 
outages.
  Deployment success rate: The percentage of deployments that are successful.
  Code quality: The quality of code as measured by metrics such as code complexity, code 
coverage, and code maintainability.
  Customer satisfaction: The level of satisfaction customers has with the software or service being 
provided.
  Employee satisfaction: The level of satisfaction employees has with the development process 
and work environment.
  These metrics can be used to assess the performance of a DevOps team, identify areas for 
improvement, and drive continuous improvement in the development process.
  
  
  Azure DevOps offers built-in functionality to automatically collect and report on several DevOps 
metrics. Here are some ways you can get these metrics automatically from Azure DevOps:
  
  Deployment frequency: Azure DevOps provides a Release Pipeline that can be used to automate 
the deployment of code changes to production. The Release Pipeline can be configured to track 
deployment frequency and report on it automatically.
  
  Lead time: Azure DevOps offers an integration with Git that provides insights into lead time. The 
integration can be configured to automatically calculate lead time and report on it.
  
  MTTR: Azure DevOps offers integration with various incident management tools, such as 
PagerDuty and ServiceNow. By integrating these tools with Azure DevOps, you can automatically 
track and report on MTTR.
  
  Change failure rate: Azure DevOps offers built-in functionality to track the success and failure of 
code changes. By using Azure DevOps Builds and Releases, you can track change failure rate 
automatically.
  
  Deployment success rate: Similar to change failure rate, Azure DevOps offers built-in 
functionality to track deployment success rate. By using Azure DevOps Builds and Releases, you can 
track deployment success rate automatically.
  
  Code quality: Azure DevOps provides integration with various code analysis tools, such as 
SonarCloud and WhiteSource Bolt. By integrating these tools with Azure DevOps, you can 
automatically track code quality metrics.
  
  Customer satisfaction: Azure DevOps offers integration with various customer feedback tools, 
such as UserVoice and Zendesk. By integrating these tools with Azure DevOps, you can 
automatically track customer satisfaction.
  
  Employee satisfaction: Azure DevOps provides integration with various employee feedback 
tools, such as Officevibe and TINYpulse. By integrating these tools with Azure DevOps, you can 
automatically track employee satisfaction.
